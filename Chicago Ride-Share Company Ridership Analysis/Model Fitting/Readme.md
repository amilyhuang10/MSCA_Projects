# Model Fitting

Random Forest Regressor was used to understand feature importances on ridership, tips, and pooled trips.<br>

**Time Series**<br>

The main characteristics of the Time Series data are shown in the [Data_Main_Characteristics_Decomposition](https://github.com/amilyhuang10/MSCA_Projects/blob/main/Chicago%20Ride-Share%20Company%20Ridership%20Analysis/Model%20Fitting/Data_Main_Characteristics_Decomposition.pdf) file. <br>
